# CryptoClustering
Crypto_Clustering.ipynb file contains:
  Cluster analysis on original, but scaled data as well as PCA (3 components). 
  Cluster visulation showed that reducing features to 3 instead of the original 7 in this example did not change identifying the two outliers. 

A second ipynb file titled ' Crypto_Clustering_PCA with only 2 components_for fun'  was created to see the impact of changing the PCA components from 3 to 2. 2 outliers were stil identified, but the remaining coin_ids were grouped as one cluster.
